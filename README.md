RETURNN - RWTH extensible training framework for universal recurrent neural networks,
is a Theano/TensorFlow-based implementation of modern recurrent neural network architectures.
It is optimized for fast and reliable training of recurrent neural networks in a multi-GPU environment.

Features include:

- Mini-batch training of feed-forward neural networks
- Sequence-chunking based batch training for recurrent neural networks
- Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks
  including our own fast CUDA kernel
- Multidimensional LSTM (GPU only, there is no CPU version)
- Memory management for large data sets
- Work distribution across multiple devices
- Flexible and fast architecture which allows all kinds of encoder-attention-decoder models

[Here is the video recording of a RETURNN overview talk](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/web/Software/returnn/downloads/workshop-2019-01-29/01.recording.cut.mp4)
([slides](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/web/Software/returnn/downloads/workshop-2019-01-29/01.returnn-overview.session1.handout.v1.pdf)).

There are some example demos in `/demos`
which work on artifically generated data,
i.e. they should work as-is.

There are some real-world examples [here](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn-experiments).

Some benchmark setups against other frameworks
can be found [here](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn-benchmarks).
The results are in the [RETURNN paper 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00895).
Performance benchmarks of our LSTM kernel vs CuDNN and other TensorFlow kernels
are [here](http://returnn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tf_lstm_benchmark.html).

There is also [a wiki](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn/wiki).
Questions can also be asked on
[StackOverflow using the `returnn` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/returnn).
