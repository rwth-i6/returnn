Optimizer Settings
==================

.. note::
    To define the update algorithm, set the parameter ``optimizer`` to a dictionary
    and define the type by setting ``class``.
    All available optimizers and their parameters can be found :ref:`here <optimizer>`.
    Setting the learning rate should not set in the dict, but rather separately.
    If no updater is specified, plain SGD is used.

    The learning rate control scheme is set with ``learning_rate_control``,
    and many possible settings are available for the different control schemes.
    For the default values have a look at `LearningRateControl.py <https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn/blob/master/LearningRateControl.py>`_.

accum_grad_multiple_step
    An integer specifying the number of updates to stack the gradient, called "gradient accumulation".

gradient_clip
    Specifiy a gradient clipping threshold.

gradient_noise
    Apply a (gaussian?) noise to the gradient with given deviation (variance? stddev?)

learning_rate
    Specifies the global learning rate

learning_rates
    A list of learning rates that defines the learning rate for each epoch from the beginning.
    Can be used for learning-rate warmup.

learning_rate_control
    This defines which type of learning rate control mechanism is used. Possible values are:

        - ``constant`` for a constant learning rate which is never modified
        - ``newbob_abs`` for a scheduling based on absolute improvement
        - ``newbob_rel`` for a scheduling based on relative improvement
        - ``newbob_multi_epoch`` for a scheduling based on relative improvement averaged over multiple epochs

    Please also look at setting values with the ``newbob`` prefix for further customization

learning_rate_control_error_measure
    A str to define which score or error is used to control the learning rate reduction.
    Per default, Returnn will use dev_score_output.
    A typical choice would be dev_score_LAYERNAME or dev_error_LAYERNAME.
    Can be set to None to disable learning rate control.

learning_rate_control_min_num_epochs_per_new_lr
    The number of epochs after the last update that the learning rate is kept constant.

learning_rate_control_relative_error_relative_lr
    If true, the relative error is scaled with the ratio of the default learning rate divided by the current
    learning rate.
    Can be used with ``newbob_rel`` and ``newbob_multi_epoch``.

learning_rate_file
    A path to a file storing the learning rate for each epoch.
    Despite the name, also stores scores and errors.

newbob_error_threshold
    This is the absolute improvement that has to be achieved in order to _not_ reduce the learning rate.
    Can be used with ``newbob_abs``.
    The value can be positive or negative.

newbob_learning_rate_decay
    The scaling factor for the learning rate when a reduction is applied.
    This parameter is available for all ``newbob`` variants.

newbob_multi_num_epochs
    The number of epochs the improvement is averaged over.

newbob_multi_update_interval
    The number of steps after which the learning rate is updated.
    This is set equal to ``newbob_multi_num_epochs`` when not specified.

newbob_relative_error_threshold
    This is the relative improvement that has to be achieved in order to _not_ reduce the learning rate.
    Can be used with ``newbob_rel`` and ``newbob_multi_epoch``.
    The value can be positive or negative.

min_learning_rate
    Specifies the minimum learning rate.

relative_error_div_by_old
    If true the relative error is computed by dividing the error difference by the old error value instead of the
    current error value.
