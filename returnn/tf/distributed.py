"""
This is for distributed TensorFlow support.
For an overview of the terminology, the concepts and the technology, see
`here <https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn/wiki/Distributed-TensorFlow>`_.

Distributed TensorFlow covers multiple levels of functionality:

* Low level:
  TF server and client (TF session) connecting to the server via gRPC.
  ClusterSpec describes the collection of all servers.

* High level via strategies (:class:`tf.distribute.Strategy`).
  See the `official guide <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training>`_.
  This can be used by the Keras API, by the Estimator API,
  and by a custom training loop.

* Concepts and terminology.

RETURNN potentially could support all of this, although it will try to be very explicit about it.
Currently we do not use the high level strategy concept but only the low level functionality.
This implementation was originally discussed `here <https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn/issues/296>`_.

This is also related to `Horovod <https://github.com/horovod/horovod>`_.
Horovod and distributed TF are orthogonal to each other.
They can both be mixed, or used independently.

This is also related to the dataset pipeline :mod:`TFDataPipeline`.

  ClusterResolver for MPI.
  Distributed TF is in general totally independent of MPI.
  We only use MPI here to figure out the ClusterSpec.
  After this is set up, MPI will not be used anymore.
  TF itself will not make use of MPI;
  all communications are handled via gRPC.
  (Although `Horovod <https://github.com/horovod/horovod>`_ would use MPI, but that is another topic.)

  If you use Sun Grid Engine (SGE) / Oracle Grid Engine,
  with the parallel environment (PE) feature
  (`doc <https://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman5/sge_pe.html>`_)
  (i.e. the SGE job was started e.g. via: `qsub -pe mpi 8`),
  then you might run your sub processes (slots) via `mpirun`, e.g. like::

    mpirun -np 8 -mca pml ob1 -mca btl ^openib python returnn/rnn.py ...

  Open MPI knows about SGE and will correctly start subprocesses (for each PE slot)
  (potentially remotely).
  From the `Open MPI doc <https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=sge>`_:

    Open MPI will automatically detect when it is running inside SGE and will just "do the Right Thing."
    Specifically, if you execute an mpirun command in a SGE job,
    it will automatically use the SGE mechanisms to launch and kill processes.
    There is no need to specify what nodes to run on -
    Open MPI will obtain this information directly from SGE
    and default to a number of processes equal to the slot count specified.

  SGE provides the `PE_HOSTFILE` env var points to a file which lists all hosts
  and number of slots per host.
  This would be available for the SGE main job process, i.e. where `mpirun` is run,
  but this might *not* be available on the subprocesses (slots)
  which are started by `mpirun` remotely.

  Within such a MPI process, the only reliable way to get information about the other peer processes,
  we must use MPI functions.
  A straight-forward simple way for this is the `mpi4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ module.
  `mpi4py` can be mixed together with `Horovod <https://github.com/horovod/horovod>`_, so this is a sensible choice.

  This is somewhat similar to :class:`SlurmClusterResolver`.
