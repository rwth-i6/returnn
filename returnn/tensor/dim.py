"""
Represents a dimension of a tensor.
A dimension can come with further information such as individual sequence lengths.

This identifies one axis/dimension, like a time-dimension, etc.
This was called ``DimensionTag`` earlier, and referred to as dimension tag.

This is used by :class:`Tensor` (earlier ``Data``). See :func:`Tensor.dims`.
This would be passed as ``dims`` when creating a :class:`Tensor` instance.

It is not to specify the specific axis in a specific Tensor,
but to specify the content and dimension.
I.e. if we have the same Dim for two Data instances,
the dimensions should match. I.e.:

    data1.dims[i] == data2.dims[j]
      =>  data1.raw_tensor.shape[i] == data2.raw_tensor.shape[j]

This also includes further information such as sequence lengths
or a vocabulary.

Deprecated: We differentiate between the batch dim, spatial dim or feature dim,
although that is just flag and in many contexts there is no real difference
between a spatial dim and a feature dim (the batch dim is often handled differently).
