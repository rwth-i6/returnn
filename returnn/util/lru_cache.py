    If *maxsize* is set to None, the LRU features are disabled and the cache
    can grow without bound.

    If *typed* is True, arguments of different types will be cached separately.
    For example, f(3.0) and f(3) will be treated as distinct calls with
    distinct results.

    Arguments to the cached function must be hashable.

    Use f.cache_len() to see the current size of the cache.
    Use f.cache_set(*args, result, **kwargs) to set a value in the cache directly.
    Use f.cache_peek(*args, update_statistics=False, fallback=None, **kwargs)
    to peek the cache, without ever calling the user function.
    View the cache statistics named tuple (hits, misses, maxsize, currsize)

    Set the maximum cache size to a new value with f.cache_set_maxsize(new_maxsize).
