    File cache.

    Copies files from a remote filesystem (e.g. NFS)
    to a local filesystem (e.g. ``/var/tmp``) to speed up access.

    Some assumptions we depend on:

    - When a cached file is available, and its size matches the original file,
      we can use it.
      (We might want to extend this logic later, e.g. by storing and checking the original source mtime.
       But for simplicity, we don't do this for now.)
    - We will update the cached file mtime frequently (every second) via a background thread
      of used cached files, to mark that they are used.
      (We would maybe want to use atime, but we don't expect that atime can be relied on.)
      Note that updating mtime might influence the behavior of some external tools.
      (If this becomes a problem at some point, instead of abusing mtime this way,
       we might store the most recent usage time e.g. in a separate file.)
    - :func:`os.utime` will update mtime, and mtime is somewhat accurate (up to 10 secs maybe),
      mtime compares to time.time().
    - :func:`shutil.disk_usage` can be relied on.
