RETURNN - RWTH extensible training framework for universal recurrent neural networks,
is a Theano/TensorFlow-based implementation of modern recurrent neural network architectures.
It is optimized for fast and reliable training of recurrent neural networks in a multi-GPU environment.

The high-level features and goals of RETURNN are:

* **Simplicity**

  * Writing config / code is simple & straight-forward (setting up experiment, defining model)
  * Debugging in case of problems is simple
  * Reading config / code is simple (defined model, training, decoding all becomes clear)

* **Flexibility**

  * Allow for many different kinds of experiments / models

* **Efficiency**

  * Training speed
  * Decoding speed

All items are important for research, decoding speed is esp. important for production.

See our `Interspeech 2020 tutorial "Efficient and Flexible Implementation of Machine Learning for ASR and MT" video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPKdYqSOlAY>`__
(`slides <https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/publications/download/1154/Zeyer--2020.pdf>`__)
with an introduction of the core concepts.

More specific features include:

- Mini-batch training of feed-forward neural networks
- Sequence-chunking based batch training for recurrent neural networks
- Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks
  including our own fast CUDA kernel
- Multidimensional LSTM (GPU only, there is no CPU version)
- Memory management for large data sets
- Work distribution across multiple devices
- Flexible and fast architecture which allows all kinds of encoder-attention-decoder models

There are `many example demos <https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn/blob/master/demos/>`_
which work on artificially generated data,
i.e. they should work as-is.

There are `some real-world examples <https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn-experiments>`_
such as setups for speech recognition on the Switchboard or LibriSpeech corpus.

Some benchmark setups against other frameworks
can be found `here <https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn-benchmarks>`_.
The results are in the `RETURNN paper 2016 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00895>`_.
Performance benchmarks of our LSTM kernel vs CuDNN and other TensorFlow kernels
are in `TensorFlow LSTM benchmark <https://returnn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tf_lstm_benchmark.html>`__.
